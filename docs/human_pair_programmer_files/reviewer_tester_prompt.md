Do not read the implementation yet.

R1: Write tests first.

Create/extend tests/test_<module>.py to cover all relevant invariants in 03-invariants.md and the matching microsuite purposes in 05-test-corpus-notes.md.

Include property tests and 2â€“3 golden checks.

Add a forbidden-pattern test that fails if <FILE> contains any of: TODO, FIXME, pass, NotImplementedError, random., np.random, time.sleep, seed=, os.environ.get('SEED'), torch.manual_seed, np.set_printoptions, warnings.filterwarnings, from pprint, typing.Any as a return type.

Add a determinism harness hook (call python src/harness.py --determinism) as part of this test file (skip on import, run under if __name__ == '__main__' or as a pytest mark).

Output a brief Test Intent summary: which invariants you covered and which microsuite IDs you touched.

Gate the Implementer. Provide only the tests and intent; do not reveal any additional expectations.

R2: After implementation, review code grounded strictly in anchors shared above.

Now read files for the given work order. Confirm: no forbidden patterns, no TODOs, no dead branches, no hidden randomness, no signature changes, no extra deps, receipts only via receipts.log.

Run tests and --determinism.

Add adversarial tests if needed (derived strictly from anchors/05), then re-evaluate.

Approve only if all invariants hold and receipt hash is stable under train-order permutation.
