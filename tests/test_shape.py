"""
Test suite for shape_law.py — Affine shape law + floor pullback.

Covers:
- I-5: Shape law precedence, floor pullback, OOB semantics
- Multiplicative, additive, mixed, bbox law types
- Pullback floor mapping (no exact boundary requirement)
- Determinism and forbidden patterns

Invariants:
- I-5: Learned law type respects precedence (multiplicative ≺ additive ≺ mixed; bbox fallback)
- I-5: Pullback uses floor mapping; undefined ⇔ OOB after floor

    Test Intent Summary for WO-07 (Shape Law + Pullback):

    Invariants Covered:
    - I-5: Shape law precedence (multiplicative ≺ additive ≺ mixed; bbox fallback)
    - I-5: Pullback uses floor mapping; undefined ⇔ OOB after floor

    Property Tests:
    - Precedence enforcement (multiplicative > additive > mixed > bbox)
    - Mixed lex-min selection among valid (a,c,b,d) tuples
    - Floor pullback (pixels between multiples map correctly)
    - OOB is ONLY reason for None (no exact boundary requirement)
    - Consistency checks (inconsistent ratios/offsets fail appropriately)

    Golden Checks:
    - Multiplicative: [(2,3,6,9), (4,5,12,15)] → [3,0,3,0]
    - Additive: [(5,7,7,10), (3,4,5,7)] → [1,2,1,3]
    - Mixed: [(3,4,9,6), (5,4,15,6)] → [3,0,1,2]
    - Identity as multiplicative: [(5,7,5,7), (3,4,3,4)] → [1,0,1,0]
    - Pullback floor with specific pixels and OOB cases

    Receipt Verification:
    - Required fields (type, law, verified_on)
    - Type enum validation
    - Law array format [a,b,c,d]

    Forbidden Patterns:
    - TODO, FIXME, NotImplementedError
    - Unseeded randomness, typing.Any as return type

    Self-Check:
    - Module loads without errors
    - Self-check can run when ARC_SELF_CHECK=1
    - All 4 law types (multiplicative, additive, mixed, bbox)
    - Pullback floor semantics + OOB

    Microsuite IDs:
    - 0a2355a6 (mixed shape with partial pullback; KEEP+CONST composition)

    Implementation Notes:
    - Strict precedence: try multiplicative → additive → mixed → bbox
    - Multiplicative: b=d=0, constant ratios (integers)
    - Additive: a=c=1, constant offsets (non-negative)
    - Mixed: lex-min (a,c,b,d), excludes pure mult/add
    - BBox: fallback only if ALL affine fail, uses posed input sizes
    - Pullback: floor((i-b)/a), floor((j-d)/c), None ⇔ OOB
    - No "exact multiple" requirement (a*i+b==i_out forbidden)
