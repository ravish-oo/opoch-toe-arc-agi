    WO-06a/b Test Intent Summary

    Predicate Builder:
    - Components: One per component from WO-05
    - Residue: row/col gcd classes if gcd > 1
    - Overlap: Translate S-views (proven), domain masks
    - Ranking: domain_size desc, L1 asc, di asc, dj asc
    - Limit: Top 16 overlaps
    - Deterministic: Fixed order

    PT Integration:
    - Order: input_color → sview_image → parity
    - sview_image: components → residue_row → residue_col → overlap
    - Pick first that splits ≥2 parts
    - No search, no randomness

    Receipts:
    - pt_predicate_counts: By family
    - pt_last_contradiction: witness + tried list
    - Each tried: pred name, parts, class_hits
    - Deterministic: Same JSON on repeated runs

    Error Handling:
    - Log receipt before raising
    - Diagnostic message with witness
    - All predicates attempted

    Domain Correctness:
    - Overlap: (H-|di|)×(W-|dj|) formula
    - Residue: Correct modulo classes
    - Components: From WO-05

    Key Properties:
    - Engineering = math: Predicates from proven structures
    - Debugging = algebra: Witness + tried list for reproduction
    - No hit-and-trial: Fixed order, first split wins
