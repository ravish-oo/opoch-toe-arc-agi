- Identity always admitted
- D4-preserving views (only invariant ops)
- Overlap translations (equality on overlap)

    Test Intent Summary for WO-03 + WO-04 (S-views v1 + Residue-k):

    Invariants Covered:
    - I-3: S-View Closure Bounds (depth ≤ 2, count ≤ 128, proof satisfied on domain)

    Property Tests (WO-03):
    - Identity always admitted with full domain
    - D4-preserving views only for invariant ops (180-symmetric → op=2)
    - D4 non-preserving rejected (asymmetric grid)
    - Constant grid admits multiple D4 ops
    - Overlap translations admitted for periodic patterns
    - Translations rejected for wrong period
    - Empty overlap translations rejected
    - Closure composes views (M∘N)
    - Deduplication by image signature
    - Closure depth not exceeded (no depth > 2)
    - Cap enforced at 128
    - Deterministic truncation (same order on repeated calls)

    Property Tests (WO-04 Residue-k):
    - Minimal period computation (row and column)
    - Period-3 rows admit residue row p=3
    - Period-2 columns admit residue col p=2
    - Mixed periods with gcd > 1 admit residue (e.g., 2 & 2 → gcd=2)
    - Incompatible periods (2 & 3 → gcd=1) reject residue
    - Residue (full domain, wraps) distinct from translation (partial domain)
    - Period = full width/height not admitted (trivial)
    - Single-pixel dimension rejects residue
    - Proof holds for all pixels in residue views

    Golden Checks:
    - Asymmetric grid admits only identity
    - Horizontal stripe admits horizontal translations
    - Constant grid admits many views

    Forbidden Patterns:
    - TODO, FIXME, NotImplementedError
    - Unseeded randomness, sleep, type hints with Any

    Self-Check:
    - Module loads without errors
    - Self-check can run when ARC_SELF_CHECK=1
    - Residue-k checks (period-3, gcd, incompatibility, dedup)

    Microsuite IDs: N/A (sviews is infrastructure; microsuite tested in integration)

    Implementation Notes:
    - WO-03 provided base S-views (identity, D4, translations, closure)
    - WO-04 extended with residue-k periods (row/col shifts by gcd)
    - Residue wraps (modulo), translation doesn't (overlap)
    - Both can coexist with different images
